# Encrypted Core Data SQLite Store [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/project-imas/encrypted-core-data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/project-imas/encrypted-core-data)[![analytics](http://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&t=pageview&_s=1&dl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fproject-imas%2Fencrypted-core-data&_u=MAC~&cid=1757014354.1393964045&tid=UA-38868530-1)]()


Provides a Core Data store that encrypts all data that is persisted.  Besides the initial setup, the usage is exactly the same as Core Data and can be used in existing projects that use Core Data.

# What's New in ECD 2.0 (as of 6/20/14)
- Many to Many relationship support 
- Upgraded to SqlCipher v3.1.0 
- Moved away from OpenSSL to Apple's, FIPS compliant, CommonCrypto
- Better unit test support
- Better SQLite cache support
- Support for more sort descriptors
- Closed many of the outstanding issues
- Tested working in iOS 6.0 - 7.1

# Vulnerabilities Addressed

1. SQLite database is not encrypted, contents are in plain text
  - CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
2. SQLite database file protected with 4 digit system passcode
  - CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
  - SRG-APP-000129-MAPP-000029  Severity-CAT II: The mobile application must implement automated mechanisms to enforce access control restrictions which are not provided by the operating system

# Project Setup
  * When creating the project make sure **Use Core Data** is selected
  * Switch into your project's root directory and checkout the encrypted-core-data project code
```
    cd ~/Documents/code/YourApp

    git clone https://github.com/project-imas/encrypted-core-data.git
```
  * Click on the top level Project item and add files ("option-command-a")
  * Navigate to **encrypted-core-data**, highlight **Incremental Store**, and click **Add**

  * SQLCipher is added as a git submodule within ECD. A `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` should populate the sqlcipher submodule directory, where the `sqlcipher.xcodeproj` can be found and added to your project.
  * To use CommonCrypto with SQLCipher in Xcode:
    - add the compiler flags `-DSQLCIPHER_CRYPTO_CC` and `-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC` under the sqlcipher project settings > Build Settings > Custom Compiler Flags > Other C Flags
    - Under your application's project settings > Build Phases, add `sqlcipher` to Target Dependencies, and `libsqlcipher.a` and `Security.framework` to Link Binary With Libraries.
    
* _Note:_ Along with the move to CommonCrypto, we've updated the version of SQLCipher included as a submodule from v2.0.6 to v3.1.0. Databases created with v2.0.6 will not be able to be read directly by v3.1.0, and support for legacy database migration is not yet supported by ECD.

# Installation via CocoaPod
* If you don't already have CocoaPods installed, do `$ sudo gem install cocoapods` in your terminal. (See the [CocoaPods website](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started) for details.)
* In your project directory, do `pod init` to create a Podfile.
* Add `pod 'EncryptedCoreData', :git => 'https://github.com/project-imas/encrypted-core-data.git'` to your Podfile
* Run `pod install`
* In your application delegate source file (AppDelegate.m), add `#import "EncryptedStore.h"`

# Using EncryptedStore

EncryptedStore is known to work successfully on iOS versions 6.0 through 7.1.

If you wish to set a custom cache size and/or custom database URL:
create an NSDictionary to set the options for your EncryptedStore, replacing customPasscode, customCacheSize, and/or customDatabaseURL:
```objc
NSDictionary *options = @{ EncryptedStorePassphraseKey: (NSString *) customPasscode,
                           EncryptedStoreCacheSize: (NSNumber *) customCacheSize,
                           EncryptedStoreDatabaseLocation: (NSURL *) customDatabaseURL
                           };
```

In your application delegate source file (i.e. AppDelegate.m) you should see
```objc
NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *coordinator = [self persistentStoreCoordinator];
```
If you created an NSDictionary with custom options, replace that line with
```objc
NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *coordinator = [EncryptedStore makeStoreWithOptions:options managedObjectModel:[self managedObjectModel]];
```

Otherwise, replace that line with:
```objc
NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *coordinator = [EncryptedStore makeStore:[self managedObjectModel]:@"SOME_PASSCODE"];
```
making sure to replace "SOME_PASSCODE" with a passcode of your own.

Also in the same file add an import for EncryptedStore.h:
```objc
   #import "EncryptedStore.h"
```

If there are issues you can add `-com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1` to see all statements encryted-cored-data generates be logged.

# Features

- One-to-one relationships
- One-to-many relationships
- Many-to-Many relationships (NEW)
- Predicates
- Inherited entities (Thanks to [NachoMan](https://github.com/NachoMan/))

Missing features and known bugs are maintained on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/project-imas/encrypted-core-data/issues?state=open)

# Diagram

Below is a diagram showing the differences between NSSQLiteStore and EncryptedStore.  Note that actual the SQLite calls are coupled fairly strongly with the layer wrapping it:

# Strings Comparison

Below is the output of doing the unix *strings* command on a sample applications .sqlite file.  As you can see, the default persistence store leaves all information in plaintext:
